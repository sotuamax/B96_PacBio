# Genome for B96 maize inbred line assembly using PacBio technology

This is a repository for B96 genome assembly, scaffolding, and annotation processes. B96, a maize inbred line, is highly resistant to multiple herbivores, including European corn borer (<i>Ostrinia nubilalis</i>), two spotted spider mites (<i>Tetranychus urticae</i>) and complex species of thrips. Transcriptome study for B96 compared to the more susceptible inbred line B73 has elucidated a large number defense genes being highly overexpressed under constitutive and/or induced conditions ([Ji et al.]()). By sequencing the B96 genome using long-sequencing technology, we provided a high-quality genome resouce for further herbivore-resistance study in maize and to facilitate the development of a more sustainable agriculture.
